(ref:caption-figure-sacc-tDCS-AE) __Frequency of adverse effects following anodal and cathodal tDCS.__ Y-axes show the number of sessions in which the adverse effect received a given rating, out of 30 anodal sessions and 32 cathodal sessions, or 62 sessions in total. The exact counts per stimulation type are superimposed on the bars. __(A)__ Intensity ratings for eight adverse effects on a 0-4 scale: 0 = "none" (data not shown), 1 = "a little", 2 = "moderate", 3 = "strong" and 4 = "very strong". __(B)__ Confidence ratings that the adverse effects were related to tDCS: 0 = "n/a" (meaning the adverse effect intensity was rated as "none", data not shown), 1 = "unlikely", 2 = "possibly", 3 = "likely", 4 = "very likely".]
