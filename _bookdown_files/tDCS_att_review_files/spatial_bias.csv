@Loftus2012;30;within subject;P3 (A,C) or P4 (A,C), Cz (ref);35 cm^2^;1 mA, 20 min;offline;greyscales;anodal tDCS of the left PPC abolished pseudoneglect (rightward shift in bias)
@Giglia2011;11;within subject;"P5 (A), P6 (C); P6(C), left forehead (ref)";16 cm^2^;1 mA, 15 min;online;landmark task;right cathodal and particularly left anodal + right cathodal tDCS abolished pseudoneglect
@Benwell2015;38;within subject;P5 (A,C), P6 (C,A);16 cm^2^;1 or 2 mA, 20 min;online;landmark task;"left anodal + right cathodal tDCS shifted bias rightward; low performers responded to 2 mA stimulation only; high performers to 1 mA only"
@Wright2014;12;within subject;P3 (A), P4 (C);ca. 50 cm^2^;1 mA, 15 min;online or offline;centroid localization;left anodal + right cathodal tDCS produced more rightward mislocalization compared to the opposite montage
_Other studies_;;;;;;;;
@Picazio2015;13;within subject;"left cerebellum (A,C); left shoulder (ref)";25 cm^2^;2 mA, 20 min;offline;landmark task;cathodal tDCS to the left cerebellum abolished pseudoneglect, but only in combination with music listening
@DeTommaso2014;20;within subject;P3 (A), right forehead (ref);35 cm^2^;2 mA, 20 min;offline;line bisection, landmark;stimulation decreased rightward errors in the landmark task, but only in men
__Hemispatial neglect (patients)__;;;;;;;;

@Sparing2009;10;within subject;P3 (A,C), P4 (A), Cz (ref);25, 35 cm^2^;1 mA, 10 min;offline;Test of Attentional Performance (neglect subtest), line bisection;no effect on neglect subtest. One session of anodal tDCS of the right and cathodal tDCS of the left hemisphere flipped rightward bias to left. Patients with small lesions showed a larger bias shift
@Smit2015;5;within subject;P3 (C), P4 (A);;2 mA, 20 min;offline;Behavioral Inattention Test;no significant effects after 5 sessions
@Ladavas2015;30;between group;P5 (A/C), P6 (A/C), contralateral forehead (ref);35 cm^2^;2 mA, 20 min;online;Behavioral Inattention Test;"group with 10 sessions of right anodal tDCS improved more than sham when paired with prism adaptation training; the left cathodal group did not improve"
@Yi2016;30;between group;P3 (C), P4 (A), Cz (ref);25 cm^2^;2 mA, 30 min;offline;motor-free visual perception, line bisection, star cancellation;15 sessions of both right anodal or left cathodal tDCS produced greater improvement on all tests than sham
@Brem2014;1;within subject;P3 (C), P4 (A);35 cm^2^;1 mA, 20 min;online;Test of Attentional Performance (incl. Posner), Behavioral Inattention Test (incl. line bisection);one stimulation session already decreased reaction time, mostly toward invalid left hemifield targets. Effect was retained 3 months later after 6 sessions in total
_Other studies_;;;;;;;;
@Bang2015;12;between group;P3 (C), P4 (A), contralateral foreheads (ref);35 cm^2^;1 mA, 20 min;offline;motor-free visual perception, line bisection;15 sessions of tDCS paired with feedback training improved scores on all tests more than just feedback training
@Ko2008;15;within subject;P4 (A), left forehead (ref);25 cm^2^;2 mA, 20 min;offline;figure cancellation, line bisection;one stimulation session decreased line bisection errors
@Sunwoo2013;10;within subject;"P3 (C), P4 (A), contralateral foreheads (ref); P4 (A), right forehead (ref)";25 cm^2^;1 mA, 20 min;offline;line bisection, star cancelllation;one session of right anodal and right anodal + left cathodal tDCS improved line bisection (latter more effective)
@Turgut2016;32;between group;P3 or P4 (C), P4 or P3 (A);;1.5--2 mA, 20 min;online;body orientation, clock drawing, apple cancellation, line bisection;8 sessions of tDCS paired with optokinetic training improved body orientation and clock drawing test (right lesions only) more than standard treatment
