@Nelson2014;19;between group;F3 (A,C) , F4 (C,A);35 cm^2^;1 mA, 10 min;online;air traffic controller simulation;"both montages prevented time-on-task performance decline that occurred in sham group, when stimulation was started after 10 min (early group); not 30 (late group)."
@McIntire2014;30;between group;F3 (A), right upper arm (ref);10 cm^2^;2 mA, 30 min;offline;Mackworth Clock Test, Psychomotor Vigilance Task;when sleep deprived for 22h, performance in tDCS group remained stable throughout the night compared to sham (accuracy in Mackworth and reaction time on PVT)
@Li2015a;18;within subject;P3 (A), P4 (C);25 cm^2^;2 mA, 30 min;"online (CRT; RVP immediately after)";Choice Reaction Time, Rapid Visual Processing;right-anodal + left-cathodal stimulation increased reaction time on CRT, only for short interval trials in the final block. Effect only present when compared to opposite montage, not sham
@Axelrod2015;45;between group;"F3 (A), right forehead (ref); Oz (A), Cz (ref)";16, 35 cm^2^;1 mA, 20 min;online;Sustained Attention to Response Task;no effects on accuracy or reaction time, but frontal tDCS did increase mind wandering
@Nieratschker2015;41;within subject;F3 (C), right forehead (ref);35 cm^2^;1 mA, 20 min;online;"parametric go/no-go [just ""go"" responses]";cathodal tDCS decreased performance at medium task difficulty (response inhibition), only for Val/Val allele carriers of the COMT gene. No effects on reaction time
@Plewnia2013;46;within subject;F3 (A), right forehead (ref);35 cm^2^;1 mA, 20 min;online;"parametric go/no-go [just ""go"" responses]";anodal tDCS decreased performance at highest task difficulty (set shifting), only for Met/Met allele carriers of the COMT gene. No effects on reaction time
@Hsu2015;39;between group;F3 (A), Fp2 (ref);45 cm^2^;1 mA, 10 min;offline;NeuroRacer [go/no-go task only];no effects on accuracy ($d'$) for the go/no-go task only, but tDCS did reduce multitasking costs
