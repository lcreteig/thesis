## Motivation manipulation

The following instruction was presented to participants after 60 min of task performance, to investigate whether motivation could improve task performance:

> You have now performed this task for one hour. The last part of this experiment starts now.
>
> During this last part, you have the opportunity to win a bonus of 30 euro's!
>
> This possibility is based on your task performance during the remaining 20 min of this experiment. Specifically, you must finish in the top 35% of participants in terms of performance.
>
> In other words, the top-35% performers in this last part of the experiment will receive an additional 30 euro's.
>
> When you are certain you have seen a short line, you should respond as quickly as possible with the left mouse button.
>
> Whenever you see a long line, do not respond.
>
> Do your best! Good luck!
